> 🔔 Oftentimes bureacrats who don't really understand technology, nor the implications of what they're doing, come along and try to impose rules on their citizens, rules that are restrictive which the people did not vote on. If the recent proponents of online surveillance who claim to care about "safety" *actually* cared about safety, then they wouldn't compromise your privacy. For decades, common wisdom has been to not upload personal information to strangers on the Internet, and certainly not sensitive information. You definitely shouldn't reveal something so confidential as a scan of your government ID just to listen to Spotify/visit Discord/watch YouTube - I'm not kidding (but thankfully data breaches *never* happen 🙄). Of course, they'll blanket such agendas in noble words, that it's "for the children", because how could you possibly argue against that? Really though, why should the inability of some parents to act like parents require you to compromise *your* security, and everyone else's? Reject overreach, reject mass age verification, and reject poorly worded laws that actually endanger children more than they help. It's *your* Internet - keep it yours.
