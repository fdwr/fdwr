> ❗ Keep the Internet open and more secure. If the proponents of online surveillance who claim to care about "safety" *actually* cared about safety, then they wouldn't compromise your privacy. It's certainly not about "protecting the kids", but that sure is a clever ploy to deflect criticism, isn't it? Why should the inability of some parents to act like parents require you to compromise *your* security? Reject overreach, reject age verification and showing your id just to visit Discord/Spotify/YouTube, and reject bad laws passed by a bunch of bureacrats who don't understand technology. It's *your* Internet - keep it yours.
